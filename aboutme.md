### My story

My name is Michał Mnich, I am currently 23 years old, I have a bachelor’s degree in finance and accouting and I’m currently studying at SGH Warsaw School of Economics.
	Almost a year ago I have started working at one of the BIG 4 companies as an Analyst. I have always wanted to improve my work and effectiveness, so I have started to write Python scripts to save some time on repetitive tasks. In the same time I have started to ask for more challenging work (big data sets) and started to write querries. As it grew bigger on me I have started to study data science and use it in my daily work. 
 	After some time as I  was growing more and more interest in the programming I have started to use Linux as it is lighter and quicker.  and implement some solutions to make my life easier in my apartment (example will be pihole and wiring sensors to measure temperature/humidity). 
 	To this day I am glad that I have grew that interest because nowadays knowing programing really give you „Superpowers”.
